# Synthetic Data Generator
## Description
SDG allow you to create synthetic data. This is a work in progress project and I plan to continually add new features.

## Features
3D spheres : rotating(4D) or not.   
Time support (4D datasets with XYZT)

## How to
To create a volume containing 3D points, simply initialize the class and use provided methods starting with ".add" to generate points.  
You can show the spots in your volume using methods starting with ".show".  
And you can export the data into a .csv file to work with the synthetic dataset.  

## Application
You need to study the rotation of a cell through time. If so you could generate a rotating sphere to represent it.
